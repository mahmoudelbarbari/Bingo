# Product-Shop Association Fix

This document explains the fix applied to ensure products are properly associated with their shops and can be filtered by seller/shop.

## Problem

Previously, when creating products, the `shopId` was null on the client side, making it impossible to:

- Filter products by shop
- Display a seller's products in their profile
- Maintain proper product-shop relationships

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced TokenStorage

Added methods to store and retrieve seller and shop information:

- `saveShopId(String shopId)` / `getShopId()`
- `saveSellerId(String sellerId)` / `getSellerId()`

### 2. Shop Creation Enhancement

Updated shop creation to save the `shopId` from the server response in `ShopDatasourceImpl.addShop()`.

### 3. Product Creation Enhancement

Modified product creation in `ProductDatasourceImpl.createProduct()` to:

- Retrieve the seller's `shopId` from SharedPreferences
- Include the `shopId` in the product creation request
- Validate that the seller has a shop before creating products

### 4. Authentication Enhancement

Updated seller authentication to save the `sellerId` from server responses in:

- `verifySellerOTP()` - after seller verification
- `remoteLoginUser()` - during seller login
- `autoSellerLoginAfterVerification()` - during auto-login

### 5. New Product Querying Methods

Added methods to fetch products by shop:

- `ProductDatasource.getProductsByShopId(String shopId)`
- `GetProductsByShopUsecase`
- `GetSellerProductsUsecase` - convenience method for current seller's products

### 6. Profile Integration

Created `SellerProductsCubit` for easy integration in seller profile screens.

## Usage

### Creating Products

Products now automatically include the seller's `shopId` when created. The system validates that:

1. User is authenticated as a seller
2. Seller has a shop created
3. `shopId` is properly included in the request

### Fetching Seller's Products

```dart
// In profile screen or similar
final sellerProductsCubit = context.read<SellerProductsCubit>();
await sellerProductsCubit.getSellerProducts();

// Or manually with usecase
final getSellerProductsUsecase = sl<GetSellerProductsUsecase>();
final products = await getSellerProductsUsecase.call();
```

### Fetching Products by Shop ID

```dart
final getProductsByShopUsecase = sl<GetProductsByShopUsecase>();
final products = await getProductsByShopUsecase.call(shopId);
```

## API Endpoints Expected

The fix assumes these API endpoints exist:

- `GET /api/get-products-by-shop/{shopId}` - to fetch products by shop
- Server responses for shop creation include `shopId`
- Server responses for seller auth include `sellerId`

## Migration Notes

Existing sellers may need to:

1. Re-authenticate to get their `sellerId` saved
2. Have their `shopId` populated if not already stored

The system gracefully handles missing shop IDs by returning appropriate error messages.
